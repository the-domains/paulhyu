  My 1st real TV regular part, which played like a soap opera at 5am on the

This rather cool poster featured my face in a snowglobe. I liked it but think that surely my name should be above the title with Belinda and Janet, since my part was named IN the title like them?

Paul's first Mu-Lan Theatre Company show and when he met the Chinese Detective himself, David Yip. They were mostly sat in the dressing room, so they chatted a lot.

Paul loved this show, which was everything he ever wanted. RNT! West End! Non Chinese part! Regional British accents! Then No 1 tour!
