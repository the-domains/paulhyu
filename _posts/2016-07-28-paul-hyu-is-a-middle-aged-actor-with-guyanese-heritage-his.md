Paul Hyu is a middle aged actor with Guyanese heritage. His Chinese grandfather was one of only two qualified doctors in Gerorgetown, Guyana in the post-war period and he had many offspring, some legitimate, of which Paul's father was one. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/07133205-a893-4a9f-8ddf-5eeda3afe844.jpg)

Born in the summer of love in London in 1967, when his father was attempting to emulate his own father and graduate as a doctor from Bart's, Paul grew up first in Kilburn, then Smallfield in Surrey, then moved to Harrogate, North Yorkshire, where he completed his secondary education in 1985, gaining 11 O-levels (6 at grade A) and A grades in both Physics and General Studies A-Level.

Paul went for a short while to Leeds University where he started studying Physics before switching to Psychology. He secretly auditioned for a new London based drama school - The London Theatre School - and was offered a place. He quit Leeds and went to join his school mate, who was already enrolled at the Academy of Live & Recorded Arts, in his bedist in Tooting Bec. There was one single bed, mice roaming at night and the window sashes rattled whenever a bus drove past outside. Paul slept on the floor and he and Tim, for that was his mate's name, used to arrange for their one key to be more or less in the possession of whomever was thought to be back first. When this didn't work out, the one locked out would take refuge in one of the nearby pubs, or in the amusement arcade opposite the bedsit, where the owner would make us feel welcome by making us a free cup of tea. The fact we were pouring all our money into his fruit-machines made this transaction an early example of clever hospitality.

Paul's acceptance of this place at The London Theatre School was partly because the school, being relatively new, needed promising pupils and they had decided to offer him a scholarship. This meant he could save his grant and go back to University afterwards, which made sense. It also meant he could sign on as unemployed and get his rent paid, which also made sense. 

Paul graduated a few years later and soon found work with an outfit called White Horse Theatre. They were based in Germany and their motto was "Theater zum Englisch lernen". Paul and his two actor colleagues were to drive around Germany in a van going to schools and perform two set texts, which the schools had been sent prior. Paul's fluent German meant that at the age of only 22 he was in charge of the group. He had power of attorney over the owner's account, even! The major upside of all this, apart from the hordes of girls, who threw themselves at him and the confidence it gave him, was the discovery that Paul could use this employment to get his elusive Equity Card. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a51a816a-f57d-4861-8958-12777bc238f2.jpg)

Since then, 1989, Paul has never been back to university because somehow or other he managed to find work as an actor - and then as a popular Elvis (less an impersonator, and more an Elvis-inspired character act). He still lives in London, is married and has a 15 year old son. He has a modest house and a small retreat in Yorkshire. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/af64d687-dd16-436f-b325-28aad209ed24.jpg)
